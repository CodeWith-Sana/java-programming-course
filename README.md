Java Basics
This section includes simple Java programs that cover the basics of the Java programming language, such as:

Variables and Data Types: Examples of how to declare and use different data types.
Control Structures: Conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).
Methods: Creating and calling methods with and without parameters.
Arrays: Examples demonstrating the use of single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
Classes and Objects
Here you will find examples related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java:

Classes and Objects: How to define classes, create objects, and use them.
Inheritance: Examples that show how to inherit properties and methods from another class.
Polymorphism: Understanding method overloading and overriding.
Encapsulation: Examples demonstrating how to use private fields and public methods to protect data.
Abstraction: Using abstract classes and interfaces to define abstract data types.
GUI Development
This section contains examples of building graphical user interfaces using Java's Swing framework:

JFrame and JPanel: Creating basic windows and panels.
JButton, JLabel, JTextField: Adding buttons, labels, and text fields to a GUI.
Layouts: Understanding different layout managers like FlowLayout, BorderLayout, GridLayout, and BoxLayout.
Event Handling
Learn how to handle user actions such as button clicks and keyboard events:

ActionListener: Implementing action listeners to handle button clicks.
MouseListener and MouseMotionListener: Handling mouse events such as clicks and movements.
KeyListener: Capturing keyboard inputs and responding to key events.
WindowListener: Handling window events like opening, closing, minimizing, etc.
How to Run
To run any of the Java programs in this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sana-Salam/java-programming-course


Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from here.
IDE (Optional): While you can compile and run Java programs from the command line, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans can make development easier.
